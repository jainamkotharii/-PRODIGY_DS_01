# PRODIGY_DS_01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Here's my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I immersed myself in the provided dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to build a fundamental understanding of the data's characteristics. A core part of this involved creating a visualization that effectively illustrates the distribution of a selected variable.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is worldpopulationdataset which is uploaded in this repository. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

## Tools and Libraries used

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlip
5. Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here's how I conducted the EDA:

Cleaned the Data: I rigorously checked for and managed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data integrity.
Visualized Distributions: I generated bar charts and stacked charts to effectively show how categorical and continuous variables were distributed across the dataset.

## Conclusion
To summarize, this exploratory data analysis successfully illuminated the distribution patterns of the selected variable, providing a robust understanding of its characteristics. This work establishes a solid foundation for future analytical and predictive modeling efforts.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
